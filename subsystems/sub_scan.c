     *      width = 2 * range * tan(span/2)
     *
     *  Picture the sensor at the tip of a triangle, with the obstacle's
     *  left and right edges as the other two corners; `range` is roughly
     *  the distance to the middle of it, and `span` is the angle (in
     *  degrees) the obstacle sweeps through from the sensor's point of
     *  view (first_hit to last_hit). Basic right-triangle trig says
     *  half the width is range * tan(half the span) — this is the same
     *  formula an old-fashioned surveyor would use to estimate the width
     *  of something across a field just by pacing off one distance and
     *  reading two angles.
     *
     *  Why tan(x) is replaced with plain x here: for spans under about
     *  60 degrees, tan(x) (in radians) is close enough to x itself that
     *  the error is smaller than the HC-SR04's own 15 degree beam width
     *  (i.e. the sensor's own fuzziness already dwarfs this
     *  approximation's error). This "small-angle approximation" trades a
     *  tiny bit of accuracy for completely avoiding a call to a real
     *  tan() function — the RP2040 has no hardware floating-point unit
     *  (FPU), so a software tan() would be slow and would also need
     *  float/double math, which this whole codebase avoids (see
     *  TEAM_GUIDE.md §2). Everything below is done with only integer
     *  multiply/divide.

     *  The arithmetic, step by step:
     *    span_ddeg: the angular span in *tenths of a degree* (so it's
     *      still a whole number even though the real difference may not
     *      be a multiple of 10) — last_hit minus first_hit, times 10.
     *    span_mrad: that span converted to *milliradians* (thousandths of
     *      a radian) — since 1 degree = pi/180 radians = 17.4533 tenths
     *      of a milliradian per tenth-of-a-degree, multiplying by 1745
     *      and dividing by 1000 does that conversion using only integers.
     *    width_mm: closest (the distance in mm) times span_mrad (the
     *      angle in "radians x 1000"), divided by 1000 to undo that same
     *      scaling — this is exactly `range * span_in_radians`, which by
     *      the small-angle approximation above stands in for
     *      `2 * range * tan(span/2)` (the factor of 2 and the /2 on the
     *      angle cancel out algebraically, which is why the code doesn't
     *      show them separately).
