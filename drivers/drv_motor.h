/*
 *  drv_motor.h  -  Buddy 2 hardware layer
 *
 *  Robo Pico drives each motor with two PWM pins rather than a PWM pin
 *  plus a direction bit. Forward is PWM on MxA with MxB held low, reverse
 *  swaps them, brake is both high, coast is both low.
 *
 *  This layer is pure output. It has no idea how fast the car is actually
 *  going. Closing that loop is sub_motion's job.
 *
 *  Beginner notes (see TEAM_GUIDE.md §0 for the bigger picture):
 *  - "PWM" = Pulse Width Modulation. The pin is flipped on/off thousands
 *    of times a second; the *fraction* of time it's on ("duty cycle")
 *    controls how much average power the motor sees. 100% duty = full
 *    power, 0% = off. There's no analogue voltage knob on this chip, so
 *    this on/off flicker trick is how "half speed" is created digitally.
 *  - "permille" = parts per thousand, this codebase's stand-in for a
 *    percentage with two extra digits of precision (avoids needing
 *    fractional numbers, which this chip can't do fast - see §2 in
 *    TEAM_GUIDE.md, "No floating point anywhere").
