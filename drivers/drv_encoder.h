/*
 *  drv_encoder.h  -  Buddy 2 hardware layer
 *
 *  Two-channel (A/B, "quadrature") encoders, one per wheel. The two
 *  channels are the same signal offset by a quarter of a slot, so at the
 *  instant A rises, B is low when the wheel turns one way and high when
 *  it turns the other. Channel A raises the edge interrupt and is
 *  counted; channel B is read inside that interrupt to get direction. So
 *  direction IS measured from the wheel itself - including during the
 *  moment it is still coasting after a reversal - not guessed from the
 *  last motor command.
 *
 *  Which sense of B is "forward" depends on how the encoder is mounted.
 *  If a wheel reads negative when the car is driven forward, swap that
 *  encoder's A and B wires rather than adding a sign in software.
 *
 *  Timing comes from the free-running microsecond counter inside the
 *  edge ISR (Interrupt Service Routine - code the chip jumps to the
 *  instant the sensor pin changes state, see TEAM_GUIDE.md §1.2), not
 *  from the kernel tick, so speed is usable down to very low RPM without
 *  a long averaging window.
 *
 *  "Odometry" (used throughout this project) just means: turning a count
 *  of wheel clicks into a distance and a speed - the same idea as
 *  counting clicks on a bicycle's spoke card.
