/*
 *  drv_imu.h  -  Buddy 4 hardware layer
 *
 *  GY-511 / LSM303DLHC over I2C.
 *
 *  Read this before writing any Buddy 4 code: THIS PART HAS NO
 *  GYROSCOPE. It is a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis magnetometer on
 *  two separate dice with two separate I2C addresses. That changes three
 *  of the tasks in the project brief:
 *
 *    - Tilt must come from the gravity vector in the accelerometer, not
 *      from integrating a rate.
 *    - Turn rate has no direct source. Use differential encoder counts
 *      from Buddy 2, which is more accurate anyway. The magnetometer
 *      will read heading but the motors sit centimetres away and will
 *      swamp it, so treat it as a slow correction at best.
 *    - Hump height cannot come from double-integrating acceleration; the
 *      drift over a two second climb is larger than the hump. Estimate
 *      peak pitch instead and convert with the wheelbase. See
 *      sub_terrain.c for that.
 *
 *  The driver itself just produces calibrated samples. Interpretation
 *  lives in sub_terrain.
