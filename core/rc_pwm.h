/*
 *  rc_pwm.h
 *
 *  Thin layer over the BSP PWM helpers.
 *
 *  The BSP gives pwm_set_pin / pwm_set_wrap / pwm_set_cc /
 *  pwm_set_enabled but no clock divider, and the reset divider of 1.0 at
 *  a 125 MHz system clock puts the lowest achievable frequency at about
 *  1.9 kHz. A 50 Hz servo is impossible without touching PWM_CHx_DIV, so
 *  this module adds that one register write and wraps the rest in a
 *  frequency-and-duty API.
 *
 *  Slice sharing matters: channels A and B of one slice share TOP and
 *  DIV, so they share a frequency. The pin map in rc_config.h is chosen
 *  so that pins which must share a frequency land on the same slice.
 *
 *  Slice = (gpio >> 1) & 7:
 *     GP8/GP9   slice 4   left motor,  both channels, same frequency
 *     GP10/GP11 slice 5   right motor, both channels, same frequency
 *     GP14/GP15 slice 7   scan servo on GP15 (servo port 4) at 50 Hz
 *
 *  Slices 4, 5 and 7 are therefore unavailable to StartPhysicalTimer,
 *  which on this port is built on the PWM block.
