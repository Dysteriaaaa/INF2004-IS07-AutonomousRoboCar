/*
 *  rc_gpioirq.h
 *
 *  Per-pin edge callbacks on top of the single IO_IRQ_BANK0 vector.
 *
 *  The RP2040 gives all 30 GPIOs one interrupt line. Three drivers need
 *  edges (two encoders, the ultrasonic echo, the barcode sensor), so
 *  something has to demultiplex. This module owns the vector and hands
 *  each pin to its registered handler.
 *
 *  Handler contract
 *  ----------------
 *   - Runs in INTERRUPT context, not task context.
 *   - Must be short. Timestamp, update a counter, publish an event,
 *     return. No printing, no waiting, no tk_ calls other than the ones
 *     documented as interrupt safe (tk_set_flg, tk_sig_sem, tk_isig_tim).
 *   - `level` is the pin state read at entry, which is a hint rather than
 *     a guarantee on a fast edge.
